# Explaining Structs in Go

This section is learning of the fundimentals of structs in go. Going through syntax and examples of how this relates to other programming languages. Similarly to Ruby on Rails, there are no semi-colons at the end of lines as you would expect in PHP or Javascript. 

In Go, a struct is a composite data type that groups together zero or more fields under a single name. Each field can have its own type, making structs useful for modeling real-world entities or logical groupings of data.

Unlike classes in object-oriented languages, structs do not support inheritance, but methods can be defined on them to provide behavior. Structs are often used as the foundation for building more complex types in Go programs.
